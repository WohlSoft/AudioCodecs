# AudioCodecs collection

A collection of various audio codecs and their dependencies.

This is a set of dependencies required for SDL Mixer X audio library, except of SDL2 which is updating offten.

This set of libraries is designed to be buildable through CMake building system.

Note: to build libtimidity-sdl, you need to have the latest libSDL2 being installed, or enable the local SDL2 build. (This library was being modified to support files through SDL_RWops() API)

# How to build

## Linux
You will need:
* CMake >= 3.2
* GCC and G++ >= 4.8
* libSDL2 library package installed, OR you can use -DUSE_LOCAL_SDL2=ON to use the vendored copy of SDL2 instead, or use the -DDOWNLOAD_SDL2_DEPENDENCY=ON CMake flag to automatically download from [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) using `SDL2` branch and build this.

**System install** _(will be installed with /usr/local/ prefix)_
```bash
# Step 1: Download repository
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git
cd AudioCodecs

# Step 2: PRepare build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Step 3: Configure project ()
cmake ..

# Step 4: Build
make
# Hint: to speed-up build use -j <num jobs> flag. Count of jobs should be equal number of CPU cores

# Step 5: Install
sudo make install
```

**Custom install** _(You can install result into any folder and you don't need to have root to install)_
```bash
# Step 1: Download repository
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git
cd AudioCodecs

# Step 2: PRepare build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Step 3: Configure project ()
cmake -DDOWNLOAD_SDL2_DEPENDENCY=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/AudioCodecs/ ..

# Step 4: Build and install
cmake -build . -config release -target install -- -j 2
#   Tip: instead of "release" you can have "debug" to build debug versions. Instead of "2" put your actual count of CPU cores
```

## macOS
The build for macOS is very similar to Linux way, you just can follow Linux way to build libraries

## Windows
You will need:
* CMake >= 3.2
* MinGW >= 4.8, MinGW-w64 >= 5, or MSVC >=2015 (on your taste)

**Build with MinGW**
```winbatch
rem Step 1: Download repository
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git
cd AudioCodecs

rem Step 2: PRepare build directory
mkdir build
cd build

rem Step 3: Configure project
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DDOWNLOAD_SDL2_DEPENDENCY=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%UserProfile%\MyLibs\ ..

rem Step 4: Build and install
cmake -build . -config release -target install -- -j 2
rem Tip: instead of "release" you can have "debug" to build debug versions. Instead of "2" put your actual count of CPU cores
```

**Build with MinGW-w64** (A way to get 64-bit Windows assemblies)
```winbatch
rem Step 1: Download repository
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git
cd AudioCodecs

rem Step 2: PRepare build directory
mkdir build
cd build
rem Important: You must to set the MinGW-w64 path first, also you must to remove a git from PATH if it is set
rem Full path may be different in dependence of version. Please fix this to match with your
set PATH=C:\mingw-w64\x86_64-6.3.0-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev1\mingw64\bin;%PATH:C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin;=%

rem Step 3: Configure project
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DDOWNLOAD_SDL2_DEPENDENCY=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%UserProfile%\MyLibs\ ..

rem Step 4: Build and install
cmake -build . -config release -target install -- -j 2
rem Tip: instead of "release" you can have "debug" to build debug versions. Instead of "2" put your actual count of CPU cores
```

**Build with MSVC**
```winbatch
rem Step 1: Download repository
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git
cd AudioCodecs

rem Step 2: PRepare build directory
mkdir build
cd build

rem Step 3: Configure project
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -DDOWNLOAD_SDL2_DEPENDENCY=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%UserProfile%\MyLibs\ ..
rem HINT: If you want to have 64-bit build, use "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" generator
rem HINT: You can take full list of available generators by requesting of "cmake --help"

rem Step 4: Build and install
cmake -build . -config release -target install -- -j 2
rem Tip: instead of "release" you can have "debug" to build debug versions. Instead of "2" put your actual count of CPU cores
```
